This problem was presented to me by my grandad.

Suppose you have a circle with 1 point on it, the area of the circle has a unit.
Suppose there is two points on the circle then connect the points, there is two units.
3 connected points leads to 4 areas
etc etc.

Explore this sequence and its underlaying properties. Find a general rule for point n.
